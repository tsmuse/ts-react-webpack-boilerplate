# React Project boilerplate

This is my personal starting point for ReactJS projects. It's set up for me and my needs. Feel free to grab it and modify it to fit your needs if you think it's cool or useful. 

## to setup

``` yarn install  ```

## to run in dev mode

```yarn start ```

## to build 

```yarn build```
